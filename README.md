# sapi-demo
Repository for Kubernetes service configurations and SAPI-application


PostgresDB deployment is based on the following documentation: https://sweetcode.io/how-to-deploy-postgresql-instance-to-kubernetes/

SAPI-images are built on my personal test instance and pushed to a private Docker image repository.
